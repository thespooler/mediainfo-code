 <title>Bundled with a software distribution network</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2 class="First">MediaInfo is bundled with a software distribution network</h2>
    The software distribution network displays advertisements during the installation of software.
	These advertisements allow the end user to install the advertisers' program if they want to.
	When user installing MediaInfo chooses to install the promoted package, revenue is generated and shared between the software distribution network and MediaInfo developers.<br />
    <h2>Is it adware?</h2>
    Some may consider the software distribution network as an adware.<br />
    On the other hand, the software distribution network does not demonstrate the negative characteristics commonly associated with adware:
    <ul>
      <li>Advertisement is only shown as one step of software installation. Once MediaInfo is installed, you do not receive any more advertisements.</li>
      <li>No unwanted software is installed. User has to explicitly (<b><i>Agree</i></b> button) choose to install promoted software to actually receive it. You choose</li>
      <li>No private information are collected. Installation program collects only information necessary to choose relevant advertisement to be displayed, such as geo-location, operating system and language.</li>
    </ul>
    For details see the <a href="http://www.installmonetizer.com/privacypolicy.php">software distribution network privacy policy</a>.
    <h2>Why did you partner with them?</h2>
    Doing so allows us to generate a little bit of revenue to help continue developing, offering, and supporting our software at no cost to our users - you.
    <h2>How does it look like?</h2>
    Below is an example of the software distribution network screen in MediaInfo installation program.<br />
    Use the <b><i>Agree</i></b> button to choose to install the recommended application.<br />
    Use the <b><i>Decline</i></b> button to continue installing MediaInfo without installing the recommended application.<br />

    <h2>What if I still don't want to have theses recommendations?</h2>
    If you still don't want the software distribution network stuff, you can:
    <ul>
     <li><a href="/Donate">Donate</a>. With $1/1â‚¬ (is it so expensive? Really?), you will have an installer without the software distribution network and no ads on the website</li>
     <li>Use the <a href="/Download/Windows">package without the installer</a></li>
     <li>Use your own installer (this is open source, you can do it!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What if I have questions?</h2>
    If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the <a href="mailto:info@mediaarea.net">MediaInfo developers</a>.<br />
