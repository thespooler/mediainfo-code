<h2><a name="Analysis"></a>Analysis</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<h3><a name="BFF_TFF"></a>MediaInfo states video is Bottom Filed First when it is actually Top Field First</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
Most of such comments come from ProRes having displayed and stored order inverted, for a reason I ignore.<br/>
MediaInfo shows how displayed order is wanted by the container, and sometimes the container says that stored order is TFF and displayed order is BFF ('fiel' atom in QuickTime header).<br/>
In that case, display of MediaInfo is:
<code><br/>
Scan&nbsp;type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Interlaced<br/>
Scan&nbsp;order&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Bottom&nbsp;Field&nbsp;First<br/>
Scan&nbsp;order,&nbsp;stored/displayed&nbsp;inverted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Yes<br/>
</code>
Meaning that displayed order is BFF but raw stream stored order is TFF. Some player do not obey the inversion metadata from the QuickTime container so you can sometimes see TFF.
Update: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mediainfo/bugs/841/">There is a discussion about a technical report</a> and the output may change in the future</div>

<h2><a name="General"></a>General</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<h3><a name="URL"></a>What is the canonical URL of the website?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
http://mediaarea.net/MediaInfo<br/>
</div>

<h3><a name="OpenCandy"></a>The installer tries to connect to the Internet!</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<a href="http://www.opencandy.com/what/">OpenCandy</a> is used by the Windows GUI installer for recommending other software you may find valuable during the installation .<br/>
You can look at the <a href="http://www.opencandy.com/privacy-policy/">OpenCandy privacy policy</a>.<br/>
If you don't have an OpenCandy screen during the install, or if you don't click on "Yes, Install" (this is NOT the default action) in this screen, nothing is done.<br/>
If even with these explanations you don't want OpenCandy stuff, you can:
<ul>
 <li>Pay me every month for not having it (I spend a lot of time on MediaInfo, and I try to live from this work)</li>
 <li>Use the <a href="/Download/Windows">package without the installer</a></li>
 <li>Use your own installer (this is open source, you can do it)</li>
 <li>Donate! Donors (whatever the donation) don't have the OpenCandy screen</li>
</ul>
Keep in mind that nothing is installed without your consent.<br/>
More information is available at the <a href="/Bundled">Powered by OpenCandy</a> page.<br/>
</div>

<h3><a name="Internet"></a>MediaInfo tries to connect to the Internet!</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
Yes, it tries (if "Check for newest version" is checked).<br/>
When this checkbox is checked, MediaInfo connects to mediaarea.eu website too for <strong>anonymous</strong> statistics. (how often MediaInfo is used, which OS/Language/Country is the most used...)<br/>
If you don't want to autorize anonymous statistics, uncheck the "Check for newest version" checkbox.
</div>

<h3><a name="MultipleNames"></a>In the SourceForge repository, there are multiple filenames. Which one should I download?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
It depends on what you require:
<ul>
 <li>A graphical interface : MediaInfo GUI</li>
 <li>A Command line interface : MediaInfo CLI</li>
 <li>A DLL to interface with other software : MediaInfo DLL</li>
</ul>
<br/>
After this, you must select your operating system:
<ul>
 <li>Win : Windows 95 to Windows XP</li>
 <li>Lin : Linux distribution</li>
</ul>
<br/>
And your platform:
<ul>
 <li>686 : Intel Pentium, AMD Athlon</li>
 <li>AMD64 : Intel EMT64  enabled CPU, AMD Athlon64</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="MultipleVersions"></a>In the SourceForge repository, there are multiple file versions. Which one should I download?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
Always the latest version, except if:
<ul>
 <li>The version is tagged "beta". You can download this, but be warned, this is not a stable version.</li>
 <li>The person who asked you to download specified the version. Download this version, as the developer may not have tested the latest version</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="NoSupport"></a>Why is <em>format</em> not supported?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
Because I don't have specifications for it!<br/>
If you have documentation about the format, please <a href="mailto:info@mediaarea.net">contact me</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="NoDetection"></a>A file is not properly detected. What should I do?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
Please <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mediainfo/bugs/">open a ticket</a>. I'd like a copy of your file.
</div>

<h3><a name="NoTranslation"></a>I would like to have MediaInfo translated into my language. Why don't you translate it into my language?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
Because I don't speak your language! ;-)<br/>
If you have an hour, you can translate it (in the options dialog box), and send me the file (from ./plugins/ directory). This is not difficult; you only need some knowledge of English.
</div>

<h3><a name="BinaryPrefix"></a>What's KiB, MiB, GiB?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
These are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix">binary prefixes</a>.<br/>
For example, 1 KiB is 1024 bytes, 1 KB is 1000 bytes.<br/>
The difference is not important with small files (only 2.4% for "K"), but becomes more and more important with bigger numbers (1 GB is only ~0.93 GiB, 1 TB is only 0.90 TiB!).<br/>
MediaInfo makes every attempt to be precise and does not tolerate errors of such magnitude when posting numbers even though Microsoft continues to confuse the issue in its operating system.<br/>
See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#IEC_standard_prefixes">Binary prefix Wikipedia page</a> for more information.<br/>
Anyway you can:
<ul>
 <li>use the complete output with raw values (-f in the CLI or "advanced mode" in the GUI) --> "File size: 4700000000" instead of "File size: 4.37 GiB"</li>
 <li>use your own language file (--Language=file://xxx.csv in the CLI, choose your own language file in the GUI). Language files are in the GUI package, you can edit " GiB" and other fields as you desire).<br/>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="Thousand separator"></a>Why are there spaces in numbers?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
Yes, there is a space in "1 920 pixels" for example.<br/>
This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousands_separator#Examples_of_use">international standard</a> ("SI style").<br/>
This standard is the official one for 96% of the world population (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI">All countries except U.S.A.</a>).
I currently don't plan to change this default display although you can:
<ul>
 <li>use the complete output with raw values (-f in the CLI or "advanced mode" in the GUI) --> "Width: 1920"</li>
 <li>use your own language file (--Language=file://xxx.csv in the CLI, choose your own language file in the GUI). Language files are in the GUI package, you can edit the "Thousand_Separator" field as you desire).<br/>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="NoQuestion"></a>My question is not here. What should I do?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
You might get help on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mediainfo/discussion/">forums</a>.
</div>
</div>

<h2><a name="GUI"></a>MediaInfo GUI</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<h3><a name="Licence_GUI"></a>What is the license?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
MediaInfoGUI is governed by a <a href="../License">BSD-style license</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="BuildFromSources_GUI"></a>How do I compile from source?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
The source code can be downloaded <a href="/Download/Source">here</a>.<br/>
You need Borland C++ 6 to compile it.<br/>
There is a <a href="/Support/Build_From_Sources/ThirdParty">help file to assist in compiling dependencies</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="GUI_Linux"></a>Why isn't there a GUI version of MediaInfo for Linux?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
VCL (the graphical library of Borland) is not portable (this is the only one), so I can't adapt the GUI for Linux.<br/>
If you know how to program with wxWidgets (a standard graphical library), and are interested in adapting MediaInfo to wxWidgets, then I am interested. Please <a href="mailto:info@mediaarea.net">contact me</a>!<br/>
</div>
</div>

<h2><a name="Cmd"></a>MediaInfo Cmd</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<h3><a name="Licence_Cmd"></a>What is the license?</h3>

MediaInfoCmd is governed by a <a href="../License">BSD-style license</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="Cmd_Options"></a>Why aren't there more options for the command line?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
I didn't spend much time coding it, due to less interest from users.<br/>
You can add a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mediainfo/feature-requests/">feature request</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="BuildFromSources_Cmd"></a>How do I compile from source?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
The source code can be downloaded <a href="/Download/Source">here</a>.<br/>

<h2><a name="Dll"></a>MediaInfo DLL</h2>
<div class="paragraph-block">
<h3><a name="Licence_Dll"></a>What is the license?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
MediaInfoDLL is governed by a <a href="../License">BSD-style license</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="NoSoftware"></a>Why doesn't the DLL work with <em>software name</em>?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
Maybe the software doesn't support the latest version of the DLL.<br/>
<ul>
 <li>Try asking the software developer to modify his software</li>
 <li>Try downloading an older version of the DLL</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="SDK"></a>How do I import data from your DLL?</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
Download the DLL package. There are some examples, in many different languages (standard C, standard C++, GCC, MinGW, Borland C++ Builder, Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft C#, Microsoft J#)<br/>
There is also an <a href="/Support/SDK">SDK</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="StaticLib"></a>I'd rather have static libraries</h3>
<div class="paragraph-block">
This is only possible with C++.<br/>
On the download page, there is package with:
<ul>
 <li>Library compiled with Borland C++ builder 6</li>
 <li>Library compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 9 (aka 2005). Warning : the project is statically linked to the multithreaded C++ library, and options are C++ compliant (Be careful. In standard C++, wchar_t is a type, not a short int).</li>
</ul>
If you want to use other compilers or options, you must <a href="/Support/Build_From_Sources">compile from source</a>.
