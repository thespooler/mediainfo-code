	<title>Bundled with a software distribution network</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2 class="First">MediaInfo is distributed by a Commercial Organisation</h2>
	The software distributor displays advertisements during the <b>installation</b> of our software.
	These ads enable the end user to install the advertisers' programs if they want to. When a MediaInfo installer chooses to install an advertised package, the generated revenue is shared between the distributor and MediaInfo.<br />
	There is absolutely no post-installation advertising with MediaInfo. Nor is there any "call home" (except if you want to be informed of new releases - you can uncheck the corresponding checkbox in the preference screen, at any time, if you don't want to be informed of new versions).<br />

	<h2>Is it adware?</h2>
	Some may consider this distribution "bundling" as adware. On the other hand, the distributor does not show the usual nasty negative traits of adware:
	<ul>
		<li>Ads are shown only as one step in the MediaInfo installation. Once installed - no more ads! That's a promise.</li>
		<li>No unwanted software is installed - sponsored offer is explicitely indicated as such. Totally your choice!</li>
		<li>No private information is gathered from you except for basic data polling such as language, OS and geographic location for advertisement selection during installation.</li>
	</ul>
	For details see the <a href="http://www.avg.com/ww-en/privacy">software distribution network privacy policy</a>.

	<h2>Why did you partner with them?</h2>
	In order to generate a little bit of revenue to help continue developing, offering, and supporting our software at no cost to our users - you. Software developers who have starved to death in poverty are precious little use at improving their products.

	<h2>How does the installation UI look like?</h2>
	Below is an example of the software distribution network screen in the MediaInfo installation program:<br />
	Click the "<b><i>Next</i></b>" button to choose to install the advertised application.<br />
	Click the  "<b><i>Decline</i></b>" button to continue installing MediaInfo without installing the advertised application.<br />
	<br />

	<h2>What if I still don't want to be pestered by these ads?</h2>
	If you still don't want the software distribution network stuff, you can:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/Donate">Donate</a>. With $1/1â‚¬ (is it so expensive? Really?), you will have an installer without the software distribution network and no ads on the website.</li>
		<li>Use the <a href="/Download/Windows">package without the installer</a></li>
		<li>Use your own installer (this is open source, you can do it!)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>How are these offers considered?</h2>
	Some download websites say:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Other-VIDEO-Tools/MediaInfo.shtml">Softpedia</a>:<br />
		<i>Users are advised to pay attention while installing this ad-supported application:<br />
	 <b>Offers</b> to change the homepage for web browsers installed in the system<br />
	 <b>Offers</b> to change the default search engine for web browsers installed in the system<br />
	 <b>Offers</b> to download or install software or components (such as browser toolbars) that the program does not require to fully function<br /></i>
		</li>
	</ul>
