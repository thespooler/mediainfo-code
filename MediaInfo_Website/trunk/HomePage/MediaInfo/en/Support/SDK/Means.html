<h1><a name="Means">Different means of use the library</a></h1>
You can use the library in theses ways:
<ul>
 <li>
  Using the Dynamic-linked library (DLL):<br />
  You can access the library from any language, if this language has "C" DLL support.<br />
  This is the case of standart C compilers, Microsoft C++, Borland C++, Microsoft C#, Microsoft J#, Microsoft Visual Basic.<br />
  Examples are provided with DLL, in most cases in the last version availble of the language.<br />
  Exception: Microsoft Visual Basic 5 and 6 are supported too, thanks to contributors.
 </li>
 <li>
  Using ActiveX:<br />
  Thanks to contributors, an ActiveX wrapper is provided too.<br />
  You can use it in Microsoft Internet Explorer or a Visual Basic Script. Internet Explorer and VBS examples are provided.
 </li>
 <li>
  Using the static library (LIB):<br />
  You can access the library from a C/C++ compiler.<br />
  Microsoft C++, Borland C++, Bloodshed DevCpp, MinGW and GCC (Linux) IA32 libraries are provided (to be confirmed)
 </li>
 <li>From source:<br />
  You can compile yourself the source.<br />
  Microsoft C++, Borland C++,&nbsp;Bloodshed DevCpp, MinGW and GCC (Linux) makefiles are provided (to be confirmed)
 </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="DLL">Use it with DLL</a></h2>
With your compiler, you can access to the DLL with some interface code.<br />
There are some examples in the DLL file released, please take a look on them.<br />
Copy the code related to the DLL interface, into your code.

<h2><a name="ActiveX">Use it with ActiveX</a></h2>
With a HTML editor or a VBS editor, you can access to the DLL with some interface code.<br />
There are some examples in the DLL file released (in the "contrib" directory), please take a look on them

<h2><a name="Build_From_Sources">Build from source</a></h2>
If you want to compile yourself, you need first some third party software, and only after this you will be able to compile MediaInfo.<br />
There is a "How to" for <a href="../Build_From_Sources">building from sources</a>.<br />
<br />
Note: You can compile it with or without UNICODE support. Best is to active UNICODE
