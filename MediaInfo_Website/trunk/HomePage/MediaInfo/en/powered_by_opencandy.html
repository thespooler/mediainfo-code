    <h2 class="First">What is OpenCandy?</h2>
    OpenCandy runs a moderated network that enables software publishers (like us) to recommend other software you may find valuable during installation of their software (in our case, MediaInfo). We get to pick the software we recommend, and OpenCandy makes sure the software on the network and the recommendation experience are held to the highest standards of quality and user experience.<br />
    <h2>Why did you partner with OpenCandy?</h2>
    After reviewing different options (such as bundling browser toolbars) we partnered with OpenCandy because they help us provide the best user experience (i.e. we can choose opt-in only, no software bundled) to people installing our software.  Doing so allows us to generate revenue to continue developing, offering, and supporting our software at no cost to you.<br />
    <h2>What’s in it for me?</h2>
    Two things! One, you get to use our software for free. Two, we hope you will discover great, useful software through an OpenCandy recommendation.<br />
    If you don't see the OpenCandy screen during the install, or if you don't click on "Yes, Install" (this is NOT the default action) on this screen, nothing is done.<br />
    Keep in mind that nothing is installed without your consent.<br />

    <h2>What if I still don't want to have theses recommendations?</h2>
    If even with these explanations you don't want OpenCandy stuff, you can:
    <ul>
     <li>Pay me every month for not having it (I spend a lot of time on MediaInfo, and I try to live from this work)</li>
     <li>Use the <a href="/Download/Windows">package without installer</a></li>
     <li>Use your own installer (this is open source, you can do it)</li>
    </ul>
