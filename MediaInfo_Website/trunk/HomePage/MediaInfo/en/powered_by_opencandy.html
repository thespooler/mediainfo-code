	<h2 class="First">What is OpenCandy?</h2>
	OpenCandy runs a moderated network that enables software publishers (such as us) to recommend other software (which we believe you may find worthwhile) during installation of their software (in our case, MediaInfo). We get to pick the software we recommend, and OpenCandy makes sure the recommended software is of the highest standards both of quality and of user experience.<br/>
	<h2>Why did you partner with OpenCandy?</h2>
	After reviewing different options (such as bundling browser toolbars) we partnered with OpenCandy because they help us provide the best user experience (i.e. we can choose opt-in only, no software bundled) to people installing our software.  Doing so allows us to generate a little bit of revenue to help continue developing, offering, and supporting our software at no cost to our users - you.<br/>
	<h2>What’s in it for me?</h2>
	Two things! One, you get to use our software free, gratis and for nothing. Two, we hope you will discover great, useful software through an OpenCandy recommendation.<br/>
	If you don't see the OpenCandy screen during the MediaInfo install, or if you don't click on "Yes, Install" (this is NOT the default action) on this screen, nothing is done.<br/>
	Keep in mind that nothing is installed without your consent.<br/>

	<h2>What if I still don't want to have these recommendations?</h2>
	If you still don't want OpenCandy stuff, you can:
	<ul>
		<li>Pay me every month for not having it (I spend a lot of time on MediaInfo, and I try to live from this work)</li>
		<li>Use the <a href="/Download/Windows">package without the installer</a></li>
		<li>Use your own installer (this is open source, you can do it)</li>
	</ul>
