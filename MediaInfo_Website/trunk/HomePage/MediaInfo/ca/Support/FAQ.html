<h2><a name="General"></a>General</h2>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
<h3><a name="URL"></a>What is the canonical URL of the website?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net<br />
</div>

<h3><a name="MultipleNames"></a>In the SourceForge repository, there are multiple names of files. Which one should I download?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
It depends on what you require:
<ul>
 <li>A graphical interface : MediaInfo GUI</li>
 <li>A Command line interface : MediaInfo CLI</li>
 <li>A DLL to interface with other software : MediaInfo DLL</li>
</ul>
<br />
After this, you must select your operating system:
<ul>
 <li>Win : Windows 95 to Windows XP</li>
 <li>Lin : Linux distribution</li>
</ul>
<br />
And your platform:
<ul>
 <li>686 : Intel Pentium, AMD Athlon</li>
 <li>AMD64 : Intel EMT64  enabled CPU, AMD Athlon64</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="MultipleVersions"></a>In the SourceForge repository, there are multiple versions of files. Which one should I download?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
Always the latest version, except if:
<ul>
 <li>The version is tagged "beta". You can download this, but be warned, this is not a stable version.</li>
 <li>The person who ask you to download specified the version. Download this version, as the developer may not have tested the latest version</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="NoSupport"></a>Why is <i>format</i> not supported?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
Because I don't have specifications about it!<br />
If you have documentation about the format, please <a href="javascript:writeTo(\'users.sourceforge.net\', \'zenitram\');">contact me</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="NoDetection"></a>A file is not properly detected. What should I do?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
I am interested in having your file. Please <a href="javascript:writeTo(\'users.sourceforge.net\', \'zenitram\');">contact me</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="NoTranslation"></a>I would like to have MediaInfo translated into my language. Why don't you translate it into my language?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
Because I don't speak your language! ;-)<br />
If you have an hour, you can translate it (in the options dialog box), and send me the file (from ./plugins/ directory). This is not difficult; you only need some English knowledge.
</div>

<h3><a name="NoQuestion"></a>My question is not here. What should I do?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
You might get help on the <a href="#">forums</a>.
</div>
</div>

<h2><a name="GUI"></a>MediaInfo GUI</h2>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
<h3><a name="Licence_GUI"></a>What is the licence?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
MediaInfoGUI licence is GPL.
</div>

<h3><a name="BuildFromSources_GUI"></a>How do I compile from source?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
Source code is downloadable here.<br />
You need Borland C++ 6 to compile it.<br />
There is a <a href="/Support/Build_From_Sources/ThirdParty">help file to assist in compiling dependencies</a>
</div>

<h3><a name="GUI_Linux"></a>Why isn't there a GUI version of MediaInfo for Linux?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
VCL (the graphical library of Borland) is not portable (this is the only one), so I can't adapt the GUI for Linux.<br />
If you know how to program with wxWidgets (a standard graphical library), and are interested in adapting MediaInfo to wxWidgets, then I am interested. Please <a href="javascript:writeTo(\'users.sourceforge.net\', \'zenitram\');">contact me</a>!<br />
</div>
</div>

<h2><a name="Cmd"></a>MediaInfo Cmd</h2>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
<h3><a name="Licence_Cmd"></a>What is the licence?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
MediaInfoCmd licence is GPL.
</div>

<h3><a name="Cmd_Options"></a>Why aren't there more options for the command line?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
I didn't spend much time coding it, due to less interest from users.<br />
You can add a <a href="#">feature request</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="BuildFromSources_Cmd"></a>How do I compile from source?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
<a href="#">Source code is downloadable.</a><br />
Note : there are a lot of dependencies, so you may have difficulty compiling them. There is a <a href="/Support/Build_From_Sources/ThirdParty">help file to assist in compiling dependencies</a>
</div>
</div>

<h2><a name="Dll"></a>MediaInfo DLL</h2>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
<h3><a name="Licence_Dll"></a>What is the licence?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
MediaInfoDLL licence is LGPL.
</div>

<h3><a name="NoSoftware"></a>Why doesn't the DLL work with <i>software name</i>?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
Maybe the software doesn't support the latest version of the DLL.<br />
<ul>
 <li>Try asking the software developer to modify his software</li>
 <li>Try downloading an older version of the DLL</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="SDK"></a>How do I import data from your DLL?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
Download the DLL package. There are some examples, in many different languages (standard C, standard C++, GCC, MinGW, Borland C++ Builder, Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft C#, Microsoft J#)<br />
There is also a <a href="/Support/SDK">SDK</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="StaticLib"></a>I'd rather have static libraries</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
This is only possible with C++.<br />
On the download page, there is package with:
<ul>
 <li>Library compiled with Borland C++ builder 6</li>
 <li>Library compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 9 (aka 2005). Warning : the project is statically linked to the multithreaded C++ library, and options are C++ compliant (Be careful. In standard C++, wchar_t is a type, not a short int).</li>
</ul>
If you want to use other compilers or options, you must <a href="/Support/Build_From_Sources">compile from source</a>.
</div>

<h3><a name="BuildFromSources_DLL"></a>How do I compile from source?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph_Block">
<a href="#">Source code is downloadable.</a><br />
Note : there are a lot of dependencies, so you may have difficulty compiling them. There is a <a href="/Support/Build_From_Sources/ThirdParty">help file to assist in compiling dependencies</a>
