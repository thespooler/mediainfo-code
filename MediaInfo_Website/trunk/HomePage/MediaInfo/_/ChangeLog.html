Changes:

Version 0.7.60, 2012-09-02
--------------
+ #3285550, GUI: added shell extension icon
+ MPEG-TS/PS: improved detection of buggy time stamps
+ DPX: color primaries and transfer characteristics
+ MPEG-TS: Added support of scrambled streams without transport_scrambling_control bit set (e.g. PlayReady)
+ MPEG-TS: Name of some scrambling algorithms
+ MPEG-TS: detection of CBR/VBR at container level
+ MPEG Video: better detection of variable GOP
x Matroska: some streams were wrongly detected sa VFR
x #3538378, XML output: invalid characters, now if there is an invalid character, data is transported in base64
x LXF: wrong video bit rate with some files
x AC-3/E-AC-3: hang up with some Little Endian streams
x AAC: wrong min and max bit rate in case of partial (default) parsing, disabling it
x AVC: crash or hang up with some malformed/scrambled streams
x Opus: wrong duration in case of non-48kHz stream
x MOV: 25 fps + drop frame time codes were not handled correctly

Version 0.7.59, 2012-08-08
--------------
+ License: Switched back to LGPLv2+Exceptions
+ #3555183, PCX support, thanks to Lionel Duchateau

+ #3540425, OGG/MKV: Opus speech format support, thanks to Lionel Duchateau
+ #3531808, AVI: detecting more inconsistencies in stream durations
+ GXF: crash with Time code tracks without frame rate info
+ MPEG-4: stream order (hidden by default), in order to provide the same numbers as mkvtoolnix 5.2+ Track ID
+ QuickTime: default channel map is "L R" for stereo streams (as it seems to be in QuickTime player)
+ MPEG-4: support of WMA (version 1, version 2, Pro, Lossless) in MPEG-4
+ FLV: handling of metadata with an underscore before the real metadata name
+ MXF: support of files with header missing TrackNumber in the descriptor (if it is present only in footer)
+ MXF: Language from DMS-1
+ ProRes: analysis of the ProRes raw stream (including scan order for interlaced content)
+ colour_primaries, transfer_characteristics, matrix_coefficients: canonicalization of results
+ MPEG-4 Visual: colour_primaries, transfer_characteristics, matrix_coefficients
+ ProRes: colour_primaries, transfer_characteristics, matrix_coefficients
+ GIF: Display Aspect Ratio
x #3533984, different behavior depending of compilation options (so Linux version was missing some info)
x MPEG-4: audio/video delay was wrong in case of negative delay
x CEA-608: Memory leaks removed
x AVC: crash in case of analyzing some invalid SEI
x MPEG Audio: crash with some files having Lyrics 2 tags
x MPEG Audio: crash with some files having APE tags
x AVI: secondary genre comes after primary genres in the "Genre" field
x FLV: better handling of files containing more than 1 meta chunk
x MPEG-TS/MPEG-PS: was aborting during full parsing in the case of very damaged streams
x Vorbis: infinite loop if codebook_entries>=256
x Id3v2: crash with some unsynchronized frames, especially with UTF-16 comments
x Id3v2: Wrong mime type of covers
x MPEG-PS: crash in case of language info in descriptors
x Java binding: crash with MediaInfo::Inform() (Windows 32-bit only)
x MPEG-TS: false-positive in case of some MPEG-4 files with wrong extension
x FLV: crash in some specific cases (malformed files)
x 3548314, MVC: Scan type was wrong with MVC-only (without the underlying AVC stream) stream
x 3553588, MPLS: stream duration was wrong with standalone (without the referenced M2TS) files
x 3553588, MPLS: incoherent behavior with MPLS having more than one PlayListItem
x 3554154, MPEG-TS: crash with some corrupted streams
x MOV: all EIA/CEA-608 captions were not well detected
x Matroska: Trying to better detect VFR streams, frame rate was wrong in case of interlaced content

Version 0.7.58, 2012-05-28
--------------
+ Ukrainian translation updated
+ AC-3: Little Endian streams support
+ LXF: AVC streams support
+ ISM: better support
+ File referencing other files (HLS, ISM...): menu in case there is more than 1 stream per referenced file
+ MPEG-TS: option for keeping streams detected at the beginning then disabled in a an update of the PMT (activated by default)
+ MPEG-PS: program_map_section support for uncommon streams embedded in MPEG-PS
x Referenced files (MXF, HLS, MOV, P2, XDCAM...): issues with source name, track order, files size
x MPEG-TS/MPEG-PS: regression, some files with AC-3/DTS/DVD subtitles were not well analyzed anymore
x MPEG-4 channel mapping: Lt and Rt (matrix-encoded) channel mapping were missing
x GXF: handling of buggy files having non-PCM AES3 codec identifier but actually having PCM
x MPEG-4: better support of MPEG-4 files having corrupted metadata atom
x 3529510, EIA/CEA-708: was not detected if the stream was not present at the beginning, thanks to Pete Chapman

Version 0.7.57, 2012-05-02
--------------
+ Basque translation added, Russian translation updated
+ #3513490, Vorbis comment (Flac, Ogg): more tags are supported
+ XML-based formats (P2, XDCAM, DCP, ISM, HLS...): support of UTF-16 encoding
+ MPEG-4: for buggy PCM, prioritizing the codec ID "in24" = 24-bit against the bit depth field
x #3516900, Vorbis comment (Flac, Ogg): trying to do better mapping of PERFORMER and ARTIST tags
x MXF: wrong video frame count in some cases
x #3517374, GCC 4.7: compilation issues removal, thanks to SpepS
x MPEG-PS: some files were not well demuxed so analysis was sometimes wrong (especially macroblock parsing)

Version 0.7.56, 2012-04-08
--------------
+ Better support of machines lacking of std::stringstream
+ Better support of machines requesting explicit stdc++ library link option (e.g. some ARM embedded devices)

x #3515393, MPEG Audio: infinite loop (freeze) with some files
x #3514677, Video: Well known 1.85:1 display aspect ratio was incorrectly displayed as 16:9
x #3513908, File interface: No output if filename contain a colon
x #3515893, MPEG-4: some specific files were not detected
x AVI: infinite loop (freeze) with some files (having index containing 0-sized chunk)
x AVC: memory leaks
x libcurl support: libcurl config from MediaInfo is compatible with libcurl+gnutls
x #3515857, CLI only: --LogFile carriage return format was not the one of the OS
