"DV Analyzer provides two primary services simultaneously:"
""
"<h4>Error Detection and Quality Control</h4>"
""
"The reformatting of DV tapes (such as miniDV, DVCam, and DVCPro) to DV file-based formats is a point when the introduction of permanent errors is of particularly high risk. Most capture tools for DV only report errors if they are significant, such as a lost frame, whereas other documented errors are not reviewed. DVanalyzer provides a way to analyze and report audio, video, subcode, and structural errors within a DV file. This enables automated quality control and the ability to verify the accuracy and integrity of the reformatting process on a frame-by-frame basis."
""
""
"<h4>Temporal Metadata Reporting</h4>"
""
"The DV format is rich with temporal metadata. Every frame may contain time code, recording date and time information, recording markers, and more. DVanalyzer reports this information which can be used in a variety of meaningful ways when working with and preserving DV content.  This is particularly useful in documenting source material of edited DV content."
