Description: DV Analyzer provides two primary services simultaneously:
 .
 Error Detection and Quality Control
 The reformatting of DV tapes (such as miniDV, DVCam, and DVCPro) to
 DV file-based formats is a point when the introduction of permanent errors
 is of particularly high risk. Most capture tools for DV only report errors
 if they are significant, such as a lost frame, whereas other documented
 errors are not reviewed. DVanalyzer provides a way to analyze and report
 audio, video, subcode, and structural errors within a DV file. This enables
 automated quality control and the ability to verify the accuracy and
 integrity of the reformatting process on a frame-by-frame basis.
 .
 Temporal Metadata Reporting
 The DV format is rich with temporal metadata. Every frame may contain
 time code, recording date and time information, recording markers, and more.
 DVanalyzer reports this information which can be used in a variety of
 meaningful ways when working with and preserving DV content. This is
 particularly useful in documenting source material of edited DV content.
